# Fire-Detection-DL-Model
Deep Learning convolutional neural network model to detect fire using built-in/external web cam.
The model plays alarm sound when fire is detected for 15 consecutive frames.

Here is a test run. Alarm sound is loud so please turn down your volume a little bit before playing it :)
