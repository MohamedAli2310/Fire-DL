# Fire-Detection-DL-Model
Deep Learning convolutional neural network model to detect fire using built-in/external web cam.
The model plays alarm sound when fire is detected for 15 consecutive frames.

Please find the test run named "test.mp4". Alarm sound is loud so please turn down your volume a little bit before playing it :)
